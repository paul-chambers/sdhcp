These are very rough scripts for Ubuntu. You must disable
network-manager, so you probably do not want to do this :D


- disable network-manager
        - must set net.ifnames=0 for resolv.conf
        - must set timeout 15 in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
        - set CONFIGURE_INTERFACES=no /etc/default/networking
                - non-intuitive but makes a HUGE difference at boot
                - networks still come up


I then copied ifup and ifdown to /usr/local/bin. This way they should
be run before /sbin/ifup but you can still fall back to the defaults.

I put sdhcp-script in /etc. This is really only needed if you are
running the "normal" dnsmasq. This is definitely optional.


- install dnsmasq
        - dnsmasq installed by network-manager not a full install
        - remove /lib/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service
                 /etc/systems/system/dnsmasq.service
                 /var/lib/systemd/deb-systemd-helper-enabled/multi-user.target.wants/dnsmasq.service
                 /etc/init.d/dnsmasq
        - add to /etc/rc.local:
          /usr/sbin/dnsmasq
          echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" | /sbin/resolvconf -a lo.dnsmasq
        - you must remove /etc/init.d/dnsmasq or systemd
          auto-generates a service
